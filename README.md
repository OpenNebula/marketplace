# Public OpenNebula Marketplace Appliances

This is a repository with YAML metadata of the appliances available in the
official public [OpenNebula Marketplace](https://marketplace.opennebula.io),
to be used with the [simple Marketplace](https://github.com/OpenNebula/appmarket-simple)
server implementation. All appliances here are built and certified by the OpenNebula Systems.

---
‚ö†Ô∏è Please report any bug or feature request [in the OpenNebula main repository using label "Category: Marketplace"](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/new/choose) üôè

‚ö†Ô∏è Important when **updating** existing appliance:

- bump `version`, so that OpenNebula clients are force to update their cached metadata
- update `creation_time` to current epoch time
- image metadata (size, checksums) must be current

## New appliance (internal steps)

Filename must be a unique UUID with `.yaml` suffix (subdirectory within `appliances/` is not important, but should reflect the nature of appliance). Use `uuidgen` or `uuid` to generate a new one. Following appliance types can be created

- **Image** - Virtual Machine Image with optional Template
- **Service** - Template for OneFlow Service
- **Virtual Machine Template** - Virtual Machine Template with images taken from other Appliances

### Image (with optional VM Template)

Example of an appliance that you can be used as a basis for a new one.

### Service (since ONE 6.0+)

Example of an appliance that you can be used as a basis for OneFlow Service:

### Virtual Machine Template (since ONE 6.0+)

Example of an appliance, which doesn't come with any disks, but imports other appliances (referenced in `disks`) and uses their images as own:

```yaml

name: Name of the appliance
version: Version of this specific appliance
publisher: Company name
