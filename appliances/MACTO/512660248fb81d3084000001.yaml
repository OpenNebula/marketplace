description: "This image has been created using Vyatta Core's Virtualization
  ISO so you can deploy a virtual router and firewall.\n\nOpenNebula's contextualization
  script for Ubuntu has been modified, so interface settings are inserted
  into Vyatta Core's configuration file instead of /etc/network/interfaces.
  \nInterface address is assigned to the VM from the MAC address using the
  MAC_PREFFIX:IP rule (using the last four octets of the MAC address) and
  a Class C mask is used for network mask. No udev rule has been modified
  as Vyatta Core's Virtualization ISO already deals with this subject. According
  to and old Vyatta's document with hardware recommendations, with 1 GB
  RAM and 2 GB HDD you could configure a router/firewall with 2-6 interfaces,
  two routing protocols and 10000 rules.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must log in with
  vyatta user and the password onerouter. The router name is set to one-vc65r1\n\nWARNING:
  The settings are not persistent unless you use the save command. If you
  use the save command, please comment the two lines following \"OpenNebula
  vm contextualization script execution\" in the /opt/vyatta/etc/config/scripts/vyatta-postconfig-bootup.script
  (use sudo to change that file) so the contextualization script doesn't
  break your router's configuration on boot.\n\nThis software image is distributed
